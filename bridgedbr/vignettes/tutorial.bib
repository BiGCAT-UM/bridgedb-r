    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Many complementary solutions are available for the identifier mapping problem. This creates an opportunity for bioinformatics tool developers. Tools can be made to flexibly support multiple mapping services or mapping services could be combined to get broader coverage. This approach requires an interface layer between tools and mapping {services.RESULTS}:Here we present {BridgeDb}, a software framework for gene, protein and metabolite identifier mapping. This framework provides a standardized interface layer through which bioinformatics tools can be connected to different identifier mapping services. This approach makes it easier for tool developers to support identifier mapping. Mapping services can be combined or merged to support multi-omics experiments or to integrate custom microarray annotations. {BridgeDb} provides its own ready-to-go mapping services, both in webservice and local database forms. However, the framework is intended for customization and adaptation to any identifier mapping service. {BridgeDb} has already been integrated into several bioinformatics {applications.CONCLUSION}:By uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services, {BridgeDb} improves capability and flexibility of those tools. All described software is open source and available at http://www.bridgedb.org webcite.},

Title = {{Presenting and exploring biological pathways with PathVisio}},
Journal = {{BMC Bioinformatics}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biological pathways are a useful abstraction of biological
   concepts, and software tools to deal with pathway diagrams can help
   biological research. PathVisio is a new visualization tool for
   biological pathways that mimics the popular GenMAPP tool with a
   completely new Java implementation that allows better integration with
   other open source projects. The GenMAPP MAPP file format is replaced by
   GPML, a new XML file format that provides seamless exchange of graphical
   pathway information among multiple programs.
   Results: PathVisio can be combined with other bioinformatics tools to
   open up three possible uses: visual compilation of biological knowledge,
   interpretation of high-throughput expression datasets, and computational
   augmentation of pathways with interaction information. PathVisio is open
   source software and available at http://www.pathvisio.org.
   Conclusion: PathVisio is a graphical editor for biological pathways,
   with flexibility and ease of use as primary goals.}},
